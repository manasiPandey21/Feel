    story: 'In 2015, Deepika Padukone revealed that she had been diagnosed with depression the year before and had sought help. The actor had spoken publicly about her struggle with depression in an interview. Speaking to NDTV, Deepika had said at the time, "I woke up one morning just feeling empty you know like this pitt-ish feeling in my stomach that I was telling them that I get this pittish feeling in my stomach. I woke up like feeling directionless, I didn\'t know where to go, I didn\'t know what to do and I had these bouts of feeling so low that I would just start crying at the drop of the hat." Deepika had also said, "If I can impact one life in this entire process of speaking up and letting people know that it\'s something I have been through and something that I could deal with because I had a fantastic support system."'

    story: 'For as long as memory served, I battled the relentless trio of anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression, shackled by an insidious force I named "the devil." Its malevolent whispers convinced me I was unworthy, destined for failure, a prisoner of my own misery. I waged a futile war, attempting to reason, ignore, and even punish myself to silence the torment. In an epiphany, I uncovered a profound truth—there was no actual devil within me. The sinister whispers were echoes of past wounds, a manifestation of insecurities, not a malevolent entity. Armed with this realization, I confronted the imagined demon, refusing to grant it power over my happiness. I ceased believing its lies, choosing not to engage in the cycle of fear and misery.'

    story: 'Just keep moving my friend, just keep moving. If you stopped now then things will only get worse. I know this time is very hard for you, all you want to do is to lie down on your bed 24*7 and cry for hours. But always keep one thing in your mind, Life is a battle that we fought every day, every fuc*king second, and you can\'t let Sadness win this. I myself were in depression for like a year, after my breakup. Maybe I am depressed right now. But one thing is very clear, that it will always get better, if you try your hardest. Share your feelings with others, make yourself comfortable with the person you trust the most. But, just don\'t make yourself isolated in your own world. Go out, meet new people, visit new places, spend time with your friends, more time with your family, try to see all those good things that\'s still left in your life, be thankful for that. Trust me these things will really help you on finding the new perspective of your life.'

    story: 'The only reason we get depressed is that we see endless suffering in our future. Without taking the future into account, suffering is just that: pain. Pain will pass. Suffer now if you must, everyone does. But don’t think about next year or month or even about tomorrow, and go live the life you have right now. Not because you feel like you have to. But because you can. You do have the energy, so long as you find anything, anything at all, to motivate you. Learning is fun. Listening to nature is relaxing. Taking a walk feels good. Drop everything off your shoulders for a moment, forget about surviving, and just live.'

But I discovered its power was just old wounds and insecurities, not some external force. I chose to confront it, refusing to believe its lies or give it control. Slowly, its grip loosened as I embraced self-love and let go of fear. Though the pain was real, it taught me resilience and gratitude. Now, I live free from its torment, radiating light and helping others find their own strength.'

    story: 'I am a victim of an acid attack by my estranged brother-in-law. The searing pain and the loss of eyesight.I remained hidden behind covered mirrors. In the dim glow of a kitchen reflection, I confronted a stranger in the mirror, driving me to a desperate night. Desperation met light when my brother Aizaz awoke to my silent struggle. In our modest Mumbai chawl, he thwarted my attempt to end the pain. Tearful and panicked, my family rallied around, reminding me of their love and the justice I needed to seek. Determined not to succumb to my attacker, I found purpose in helping others at Make Love Not Scars, an NGO supporting acid attack survivors. My life, marred but resilient, now embraces the mission to bring smiles to those who share my pain. Life, cyclical in its nature, teaches us to appreciate happiness amid sorrow. I extend a lifeline to others, urging them to keep moving, one step at a time, towards a brighter sunrise.'
