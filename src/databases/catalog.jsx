    story: `In 2015, Deepika Padukone revealed that she had been diagnosed with depression the year before and had sought help. The actor had spoken publicly about her struggle with depression in an interview. Speaking to NDTV, Deepika had said at the time, "I woke up one morning just feeling empty you know like this pitt-ish feeling in my stomach that I was telling them that I get this pittish feeling in my stomach. I woke up like feeling directionless, I didn't know where to go, I didn't know what to do and I had these bouts of feeling so low that I would just start crying at the drop of the hat." Deepika had also said, "If I can impact one life in this entire process of speaking up and letting people know that it's something I have been through and something that I could deal with because I had a fantastic support system."`

      story: `For as long as memory served, I battled the relentless trio of anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression, shackled by an insidious force I named "the devil." Its malevolent whispers convinced me I was unworthy, destined for failure, a prisoner of my own misery. I waged a futile war, attempting to reason, ignore, and even punish myself to silence the torment. In an epiphany, I uncovered a profound truthâ€”there was no actual devil within me. The sinister whispers were echoes of past wounds, a manifestation of insecurities, not a malevolent entity. Armed with this realization, I confronted the imagined demon, refusing to grant it power over my happiness. I ceased believing its lies, choosing not to engage in the cycle of fear and misery.`

I know this time is very hard for you, all you want to do is to lie down on your bed 24*7 and cry for hours, screaming at your pillow and thinking about all those things that makes your life hell. But always keep one thing in your mind, Life is a battle that we fought everyday, every fuc*king second, and you can't let Sadness wins this. I myself were in depression for like a year, after my breakup. Maybe i am depressed right now. But one thing is very clear, that it will always get better, if you try your hardest. Share you feelings with others, make yourself comfortable with the person you trust the most. But, just don't make yourself isolated in your own world. Go out, meet new people, visit new places, spend time with your friends, more time with your family, try to see all those good things that's still left in your life, be thankful for that. Trust me these things will really help you on finding the new perspective of your life.`
